**Feature 1: Upload**
The upload feature allows users to select and upload files to the Multimedia Web App. Here's how it could work:

1. The user interface should include an upload button or drag-and-drop area where users can select files from their local system.
2. When the user clicks the upload button or drops files into the designated area, an event is triggered.
3. In the code, an event handler is implemented to handle the file upload. This handler captures the selected files.
4. The selected files can be stored in the `uploadedFiles` state, which keeps track of the uploaded files in the app.
5. The uploaded files can be displayed in the UI, either in a separate section or alongside the existing files.
6. Additionally, the uploaded files can be stored in the backend or cloud storage, if desired, for future retrieval and use.

**Feature 2: Search**
The search feature enables users to search for specific files within the Multimedia Web App. Here's how it could work:

1. The user interface should include a search input field where users can enter their search queries.
2. As the user types in the search input, an event is triggered (e.g., `onChange` event).
3. In the code, an event handler is implemented to handle the search functionality. This handler captures the search query.
4. The search query can be stored in the `searchQuery` state, which keeps track of the current search query in the app.
5. Using the search query, the app can filter the existing files or the `myFiles` state to find matches based on file names or other criteria.
6. The filtered files can be displayed in the UI, showing only the files that match the search query.
7. The search functionality can be enhanced with features like autocomplete suggestions, fuzzy matching, or advanced search options, depending on the desired complexity.

**Why These Features are Appropriate Additions**
The upload and search features are valuable additions to the Multimedia Web App for the following reasons:

1. **Upload:** Allowing users to upload files expands the functionality of the app, enabling users to add their own multimedia content and work with a wider range of files.

2. **Search:** Implementing a search feature improves the user experience by providing a convenient way to locate specific files among a potentially large collection. It enhances the app's usability and efficiency.

Both features cater to common user needs and expectations when working with multimedia files, offering flexibility in managing and retrieving files within the app.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
